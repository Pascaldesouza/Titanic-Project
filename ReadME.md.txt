# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict passenger survival from the Titanic dataset. It is based on the classic Kaggle competition and demonstrates data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation using Python.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Using passenger data (such as age, gender, class, etc.), build a model to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic shipwreck.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Key Steps

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualized distributions, correlations, and missing values.
2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Imputed missing values, handled categorical features.
3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Extracted new features (e.g., titles from names, family size).
4. **Model Training**
   - Trained models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, etc.
5. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluated models using accuracy, cross-validation, etc.
